# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-30)

**Core value:** Every supported workflow must produce ChatGPT-paste-ready output in one round-trip — without the user reformatting anything.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — tech-debt-cleanup

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone: Polish & quality before refactor (visible improvements, audit-driven)
- Milestone: Audit re-score ≥ 20/24 as success bar (concrete, evidence-tied)
- Milestone: Keep `--accent-strong` for backward compat; layer new semantic tokens on top (avoids touching all 25 theme files)
- Phase 02 Plan 03: feedback.ts handler does NOT call event.preventDefault() (D-08) — browser POST proceeds normally; disabled-flip happens after request is queued
- Phase 02 Plan 03: per-page `@section Scripts` wiring chosen over global `_Layout.cshtml` include — keeps non-feedback pages from loading a no-op handler

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Brownfield production site: every phase must keep deckflow.gg green; Render auto-deploys from `main`
- VSTest is unreliable in WSL2 — verification leans on `dotnet build` clean + manual harness + push-and-watch CI
- Theme system: 25 standalone CSS forks; new `:root` tokens must be propagated to each guild file (Phase 1 scope)
- Minor cosmetic observation logged by user during 02-03 smoke check; non-blocking, no functional regression. Carry to Phase 03 backlog if user surfaces specifics.
