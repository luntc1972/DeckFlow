# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-08 for v1.2)

**Core value:** Every supported workflow must produce output the user can paste into their AI assistant and get back a useful answer in one round-trip — without the user reformatting anything.
**Current focus:** Phase 09 — bracket UX + AI selector foundation (executed; human-verify pending)

## Current Position

Phase: 09 — EXECUTED, awaiting human-verify
Plan: 3 of 3 — all SUMMARY committed (09-01, 09-02, 09-03)
Status: Visual re-confirmation pending; two regression fixes shipped post-execution (commits 32bf620, f26e63d)
Last activity: 2026-05-08 — 09-03 partial-zip upload regression fix landed

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3 (v1.2)
- Average duration: ~1 day per plan (parallel waves)
- Total execution time: ~1 day (Wave 1 parallel: 09-01 + 09-02; then 09-03)

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 9 — Bracket UX + AI Selector | 3 | 3 | ~1 day |
| 10 — Claude + Gemini Optimization | TBD | — | — |

## Accumulated Context

### v1.1 Shipped

v1.1 Admin Console shipped 2026-05-08. All 27 REQ-IDs complete across Phases 6–8 + Phase 7.1.
Phase 8 SC #5 (p95 baseline delta) deferred — no pre-deploy baseline was captured.

### Phase 9 Execution (v1.2)

| Plan | Description | Commits |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 09-01 | CSS tokens + `_AiSelector` / `_BracketCallout` partials created | (Wave 1) |
| 09-02 | `TargetAiPlatform` round-trip — model + parser + writer + zip loader | 5b4e777, e222c7f |
| 09-03 | View wiring across all three ChatGPT pages | eaf1931, ab368fa, ad8a70e |
| 09-03 fix | Download buttons formnovalidate + AI selector checked rendering | 32bf620 |
| 09-03 fix | Allow upload of partial session zips (no responses yet) | f26e63d |

### Quick Tasks Completed (v1.2 era)

| # | Description | Date | Commit |
|---|-------------|------|--------|
| b09fd46 | fix: busy indicator sticks after zip download — data-no-busy on download buttons, registerBusyIndicator checks submitter | 2026-05-08 | b09fd46 |

### Relevant Architecture for Phase 9 / 10

- ChatGPT packet form: `DeckFlow.Web/Views/Deck/ChatGptPackets.cshtml` — `data-chatgpt-packets-form`, `data-chatgpt-current-step`
- Deck Comparison form: `DeckFlow.Web/Views/Deck/ChatGptDeckComparison.cshtml`
- CEDH Meta Gap form: `DeckFlow.Web/Views/Deck/ChatGptCedhMetaGap.cshtml`
- `_AiSelector.cshtml` partial wired into top of Step 2 on all three pages (per 09-03 decision)
- `TargetCommanderBracket` wrapped in `.bracket-callout` — Packets-only
- `TargetAiPlatform` field round-trips via `ChatGptRequestContextParser` + `ChatGptPacketArtifactStore.LoadFromZip` (extended in 09-02)
- `df-select` + `required` fields need `formnovalidate` on bypass-validation submit buttons (lesson from 09-03 regression)

### Decisions

- v1.2 artifact optimization: both file format AND instructions section differ per AI platform (confirmed by user 2026-05-08)
- Phase 9 ships UI + round-trip with ChatGPT-format fallback for Claude/Gemini; Phase 10 adds per-AI artifact content
- 09-03: `_AiSelector` placement = directly after `chatgpt-step-heading` close, before first content div (consistent across all three views)
- 09-03 regression: `_AiSelector.cshtml` uses `checked="@(x ? "checked" : null)"` not `checked="@(x)"` to avoid `checked="True"` rendering

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 human-verify checkpoint still pending — visual re-confirmation needed before phase closes
- Claude/Gemini artifact format research needed before Phase 10 planning — what does a "Claude-optimized" prompt look like for deck analysis?
- Three pages need AI selector UI changes consistent across all three — verified by grep but human eyes still needed

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-09 8:48am MDT
Stopped at: Resumed and synced STATE.md to reality (Phase 9 executed, not "not started")
Next action: Human-verify Phase 9 in browser; on pass, close phase and start Phase 10 planning
