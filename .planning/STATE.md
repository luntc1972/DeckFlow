## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Milestone: Polish & quality before refactor (visible improvements, audit-driven)
- Milestone: Audit re-score ≥ 20/24 as success bar (concrete, evidence-tied)
- Milestone: Keep `--accent-strong` for backward compat; layer new semantic tokens on top (avoids touching all 25 theme files)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Brownfield production site: every phase must keep deckflow.gg green; Render auto-deploys from `main`
- VSTest is unreliable in WSL2 — verification leans on `dotnet build` clean + manual harness + push-and-watch CI
- Theme system: 25 standalone CSS forks; new `:root` tokens must be propagated to each guild file (Phase 1 scope)
